The Repository is used for abstracting how data is persisted or retrieved from a database. 
The idea behind the Repository is to decouple the data access layer from the business access 
layer of the application so that the operations (such as adding, updating, deleting, 
and selecting items from the collection) is done through straightforward methods without dealing 
with database concerns such as connections, commands, and so forth.
